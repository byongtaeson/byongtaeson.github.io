				<p style="font-size:15pt">My poker hobby started around junior year of high school. A bunch of friends of mine would go over to each other's houses and we would play. I found out that I was actually good at poker when I went to Spring Break in Panama City Beach senior year of high schooland we played at a dog track for $30. You only had to be 18 years old to play and I won first place and received $700 in profit.</p>
